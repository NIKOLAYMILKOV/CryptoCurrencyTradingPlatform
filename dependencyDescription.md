- Provides integration with JPA and Hibernate ORM for database access.
- Simplifies CRUD and query operations on database entities.

### 2. spring-boot-starter-data-rest
- Automatically exposes Spring Data repositories as RESTful APIs.
- Allows quick creation of REST endpoints without writing controllers for basic operations.

### 3. spring-boot-starter-jdbc

### 6. spring-boot-starter-test
- Provides testing libraries such as JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration testing.
- Scope set to `test` to include only in test builds.

### 7. modelmapper
- A library for mapping between Java objects, useful for converting entities to DTOs and vice versa.

### 8. lombok
- Generates boilerplate code like getters, setters, and constructors at compile time.
- Scope set to `provided` since itâ€™s only needed during compilation.

### 9. spring-boot-starter-websocket

### 10. jackson-datatype-jsr310
- Adds support for Java 8 Date/Time API types in JSON serialization/deserialization with Jackson.
